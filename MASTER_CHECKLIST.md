# Security Testing Agent — Master Checklist

A single consolidated reference covering all 19 security domains: code, API,
deployment, and the surrounding program (compliance, vendors, incident response).
Originally organized as 151 separate files; merged here into one document so an
agent or reviewer can work through it end to end without switching files.

Each item includes: what it is, why it matters, the original test checklist,
a **severity** rating, one **concrete example test step**, a **last reviewed**
date, and (where relevant) **see also** cross-links to related items.

See `UPDATE_CADENCE.md` for the review schedule and version log, and
`RESULTS_TEMPLATE.md` for how to record findings from a pass through this
document.

## Before you start

- Only point testing (yours or an agent's) at systems you own or have explicit
  written permission to test.
- Prefer staging/QA environments over production for anything in
  **Web Vulnerabilities**, **Cloud Infra & Deployment**, and
  **DNS, Email & Domain Security** — some checks there can have live side effects.
- Decide who signs off that a section is done, even if it's just you.

## 01_API_Security — API Security

### `01_API_Security/01_rate_limiting.md`

# Rate Limiting

## What it is
Restricting how many requests a client can make in a given time window.

## Why it matters
Prevents brute force, scraping, and denial-of-service abuse.

## Test checklist
- [ ] Verify limits per IP / per API key / per user
- [ ] Check for proper 429 responses with Retry-After header
- [ ] Test burst vs sustained limits
- [ ] Confirm limits can't be bypassed via header spoofing (X-Forwarded-For)
- [ ] Check distributed rate limiting across multiple servers/regions

## References
- OWASP API Security Top 10 - API4:2023 Unrestricted Resource Consumption

**Severity:** High
**Example test:** Fire 200 requests/sec at a login endpoint from one IP and confirm 429s with Retry-After start well before account lockout thresholds are reachable.
**Last reviewed:** 2026-08-29

### `01_API_Security/02_api_keys.md`

# API Keys

## What it is
Static credentials used to identify and authenticate calling applications.

## Why it matters
Weak key management leads to unauthorized access and abuse.

## Test checklist
- [ ] Keys are not exposed in client-side code/URLs
- [ ] Keys can be rotated without downtime
- [ ] Keys are scoped to least privilege
- [ ] Key usage is logged and monitored
- [ ] Revoked/expired keys are rejected immediately

## References
- OWASP API Security Top 10 - API2:2023 Broken Authentication

**Severity:** High
**Example test:** Grep the built client bundle and mobile binary for hardcoded key patterns, then rotate one key and confirm the old value is rejected within minutes.
**Last reviewed:** 2026-08-29

### `01_API_Security/03_oauth2.md`

# OAuth 2.0

## What it is
Delegated authorization framework for granting limited access without sharing credentials.

## Why it matters
Misconfiguration leads to token theft, account takeover, and privilege escalation.

## Test checklist
- [ ] Validate redirect_uri strictly (no open redirect)
- [ ] Enforce PKCE for public clients
- [ ] Verify state parameter to prevent CSRF
- [ ] Check token expiration and refresh token rotation
- [ ] Confirm scopes are enforced server-side, not just requested

## References
- OAuth 2.0 Security Best Current Practice (RFC 9700)

**Severity:** Critical
**Example test:** Attempt the authorization flow with a modified redirect_uri (e.g. attacker.com) and confirm the server rejects it rather than redirecting.
**Last reviewed:** 2026-08-29

### `01_API_Security/04_jwt_validation.md`

# JWT Validation

## What it is
Verifying the signature, claims, and integrity of JSON Web Tokens.

## Why it matters
Improper validation allows token forgery and privilege escalation.

## Test checklist
- [ ] Algorithm confirmed server-side (reject 'alg: none')
- [ ] Signature verified before trusting claims
- [ ] exp/nbf/iat claims enforced
- [ ] Audience (aud) and issuer (iss) validated
- [ ] Key rotation (kid) handled securely (JWKS)

## References
- RFC 7519 JSON Web Token
- OWASP JWT Cheat Sheet

**Severity:** Critical
**Example test:** Submit a token with 'alg' changed to 'none' and an empty signature; confirm the API rejects it instead of trusting the claims.
**Last reviewed:** 2026-08-29
**See also:** `03_Access_Control_Session_Auth/07_session_management.md`

### `01_API_Security/05_input_sanitation.md`

# Input Sanitation

**Last reviewed:** 2026-08-29

### `01_API_Security/06_cors_policy.md`

# CORS Policy

## What it is
Browser mechanism controlling which origins can call an API from client-side JS.

## Why it matters
Overly permissive CORS enables cross-origin data theft.

## Test checklist
- [ ] Avoid wildcard '*' with credentials enabled
- [ ] Explicit origin allowlist, not reflected origin
- [ ] Preflight (OPTIONS) requests handled correctly
- [ ] Test with null origin and subdomain spoofing

## References
- OWASP CORS Misconfiguration Guide

**Severity:** High

Prevents tampering and replay attacks even over secure channels.

## Test checklist
- [ ] Signature includes timestamp/nonce to prevent replay
- [ ] Signature covers full payload, not just headers
- [ ] Clock skew tolerance tested
- [ ] Key used for signing is rotated and stored securely

## References
- AWS Signature Version 4 docs (as reference pattern)

**Severity:** Medium
**Example test:** Replay a previously captured signed request unmodified after its timestamp window; confirm it is rejected as a replay.
**Last reviewed:** 2026-08-29

### `01_API_Security/09_ip_allowlisting.md`

# IP Allowlisting

## What it is
Restricting API access to a known set of source IP addresses/ranges.

## Why it matters
Reduces attack surface for internal/partner APIs.

## Test checklist
- [ ] Verify enforcement at network + application layer
- [ ] Test allowlist bypass via spoofed headers
- [ ] Confirm process exists for updating allowlist safely
- [ ] Check behavior for IPv6 vs IPv4 coverage

## References
- NIST SP 800-41

**Severity:** Medium

**Last reviewed:** 2026-08-29

### `01_API_Security/10_security_headers.md`

# Security Headers (added)

## What it is
HTTP response headers that instruct browsers to enforce protections.

## Why it matters
Missing headers weaken defense-in-depth against XSS, clickjacking, downgrade attacks.

## Test checklist
- [ ] Content-Security-Policy configured and tested
- [ ] Strict-Transport-Security (HSTS) enabled
- [ ] X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff present
- [ ] X-Frame-Options / frame-ancestors set

## References

## 03_Access_Control_Session_Auth — Access Control, Session & Auth

### `03_Access_Control_Session_Auth/01_ui_ux_access_control.md`

# UI/UX-Level Access Control

## What it is
Hiding buttons/menus based on role, purely on the client side.

## Why it matters
Cosmetic only — must never be the sole enforcement layer.

## Test checklist
- [ ] Confirm hidden UI elements are also blocked server-side
- [ ] Test direct API calls bypassing the UI
- [ ] Test role-based visibility across all user tiers

## References
- OWASP Access Control Cheat Sheet

**Severity:** Medium
**Example test:** Call the underlying API directly with a lower-privilege token, bypassing the UI that hides the button, and confirm the server still denies it.
**Last reviewed:** 2026-08-29

### `03_Access_Control_Session_Auth/02_backend_access_control.md`

# Backend Access Control

## What it is
Server-side enforcement of who can do what to which resource.

## Why it matters
The real security boundary; UI hiding is not sufficient.

## Test checklist
- [ ] Every endpoint enforces authN + authZ independently
- [ ] Test vertical privilege escalation (user -> admin)
- [ ] Test horizontal privilege escalation (user A -> user B's data)
- [ ] Deny-by-default posture confirmed

## References
- OWASP Access Control Cheat Sheet

**Severity:** Critical
**Example test:** Using User A's valid session, request User B's resource ID directly and confirm a 403, not the data.
**Last reviewed:** 2026-08-29
**See also:** `02_Web_Vulnerabilities/05_idor.md`, `03_Access_Control_Session_Auth/01_ui_ux_access_control.md`

### `03_Access_Control_Session_Auth/03_cache_invalidation_on_auth_change.md`

# Cache Invalidation on Auth/Privilege Change

## What it is
Ensuring cached session/permission data is invalidated immediately when auth state changes.

## Why it matters
Stale cached permissions can let a de-privileged or logged-out user keep acting with old rights.

## Test checklist
- [ ] Test that logout invalidates cached session data immediately, not just client-side
- [ ] Test that a role/permission downgrade takes effect without requiring re-login
- [ ] Confirm password change invalidates other active sessions (or as designed)
- [ ] Test cache TTLs aren't so long that revocation is effectively delayed

## References
- OWASP Session Management Cheat Sheet

**Severity:** High
**Example test:** Downgrade a test user's role, then immediately retry a privileged action with their still-active session and confirm it's now denied.
**Last reviewed:** 2026-08-29

### `03_Access_Control_Session_Auth/04_device_trust_fingerprinting.md`

# Device Trust & Fingerprinting

## What it is
Recognizing a returning trusted device to reduce friction (e.g. skip MFA on known devices).

## Why it matters
Weak device trust can be spoofed to bypass MFA entirely.

## Test checklist
- [ ] Confirm device trust is tied to a secure, unpredictable device identifier, not just User-Agent
- [ ] Test that device trust expires and re-verification is required periodically
- [ ] Confirm new/unrecognized devices always trigger full auth + MFA
- [ ] Test for device trust bypass via spoofed identifiers

## References
- NIST SP 800-63B

**Severity:** Medium
**Example test:** Replay a captured device-trust identifier from a different browser/device and confirm it does not skip MFA.
**Last reviewed:** 2026-08-29

### `03_Access_Control_Session_Auth/05_rbac_abac.md`

# RBAC / ABAC Models (added)

## What it is
Role-Based vs Attribute-Based access control models.

## Why it matters
Choosing/implementing the wrong model leads to over-permissioning.

## Test checklist
- [ ] Roles/attributes map to least privilege
- [ ] Role assignment changes are logged and reviewed
- [ ] Test for privilege creep in long-lived accounts

## References
- NIST RBAC/ABAC guidance

**Severity:** Medium
**Example test:** Pick a long-lived test account and diff its current granted permissions against what its role should have today, looking for accumulated excess access.
**Last reviewed:** 2026-08-29

### `03_Access_Control_Session_Auth/06_forced_reauth_sensitive_actions.md`

# Forced Re-Authentication for Sensitive Actions

## What it is
Requiring fresh credential/MFA confirmation before high-risk actions, even within an active session.

## Why it matters
Auto-login/remember-me sessions shouldn't be enough to authorize account takeover-level changes.

## Test checklist
- [ ] Test that changing password/email/MFA requires re-entering current credentials
- [ ] Test that a session restored via remember-me token still requires step-up auth for sensitive actions
- [ ] Confirm step-up auth prompt can't be bypassed by replaying an old confirmation
- [ ] Test time window after step-up auth before it expires again

## References

### `03_Access_Control_Session_Auth/07_session_management.md`

# Session Management (added)

## What it is
Handling of session tokens/cookies across the user's authenticated lifecycle.

## Why it matters
Weak session handling enables hijacking and fixation attacks.

## Test checklist
- [ ] Session ID regenerated on login/privilege change
- [ ] Sessions expire after inactivity and absolute timeout
- [ ] Secure, HttpOnly, SameSite cookie flags set
- [ ] Logout invalidates session server-side

## References
- OWASP Session Management Cheat Sheet

**Severity:** High
**Example test:** Capture the session cookie before and after login and confirm the session ID value actually changes (regenerates) rather than persisting.

# Multi-Factor Authentication (added)

## What it is
Requiring a second verification factor beyond password.

## Why it matters
Significantly reduces account takeover risk.

## Test checklist
- [ ] Test MFA cannot be bypassed via password reset flow
- [ ] Test backup codes are single-use and rate-limited
- [ ] Confirm MFA enforced for privileged accounts at minimum

## References
- NIST SP 800-63B

**Severity:** Critical

### `03_Access_Control_Session_Auth/09_session_store_caching.md`

# Session Store Security (Redis/Memcached)

## What it is
Securing the backing store used to hold server-side session data.

## Why it matters
A compromised or exposed session store can leak or forge every active session.

## Test checklist
- [ ] Confirm session store requires authentication and isn't publicly reachable
- [ ] Confirm sensitive session data is encrypted at rest in the store
- [ ] Test session store connection uses TLS where it crosses network boundaries
- [ ] Confirm session store access is least-privilege (app can't run arbitrary admin commands)

## References
- OWASP Session Management Cheat Sheet

**Severity:** High
**Example test:** Attempt to connect directly to the Redis/Memcached session store from outside the app network and confirm authentication is required and it isn't publicly reachable.
**Last reviewed:** 2026-08-29

### `03_Access_Control_Session_Auth/10_remember_me_persistent_login.md`

# "Remember Me" & Persistent Login Tokens

## What it is
Long-lived tokens that let a user skip login on return visits, and the rotation
strategy used to keep those long-lived tokens safe over time (including
refresh-token rotation patterns).

## Why it matters
A stolen remember-me or persistent-login token is effectively a stolen account
if not designed carefully — and if the token never rotates, a single leak gives
an attacker indefinite access.

## Test checklist
- [ ] Confirm tokens are long, random, and stored hashed server-side
- [ ] Confirm tokens rotate on each use (rotating refresh-token pattern), not a static reusable value
- [ ] Test that reuse of an already-rotated-out token triggers alerting/session revocation (breach detection)
- [ ] Test token doesn't grant access to sensitive actions without step-up auth
- [ ] Confirm tokens can be individually revoked (e.g. "log out all devices")
- [ ] Confirm a maximum absolute lifetime is enforced even with continuous rotation

## References
- OWASP Authentication Cheat Sheet - Remember Me section
- OAuth 2.0 Security Best Current Practice - Refresh Token Rotation

**Severity:** High
**Example test:** Use a captured remember-me token once, then reuse the same (now-rotated-out) token value again and confirm it triggers revocation/alerting rather than silent success.

## 04_UI_Framework_Security — UI / Framework Security

### `04_UI_Framework_Security/01_framework_xss_sinks.md`

# Framework-Specific XSS Sinks

## What it is
Bypassing a framework's built-in auto-escaping via dangerous APIs (dangerouslySetInnerHTML, v-html, [innerHTML]).

## Why it matters
Frameworks auto-escape by default, but these escape hatches reintroduce raw XSS.

## Test checklist
- [ ] Grep codebase for dangerouslySetInnerHTML / v-html / innerHTML / bypassSecurityTrust*
- [ ] Confirm any raw HTML rendering is sanitized (e.g. DOMPurify) before use
- [ ] Test rich text editor output specifically
- [ ] Confirm third-party embedded widgets don't inject unsanitized HTML

## References
- OWASP XSS Prevention Cheat Sheet
- React/Vue/Angular security docs

**Severity:** High
**Example test:** grep -r 'dangerouslySetInnerHTML\|v-html\|innerHTML' across the frontend source and confirm every hit sanitizes input (e.g. via DOMPurify) first.
**Last reviewed:** 2026-08-29

### `04_UI_Framework_Security/02_client_side_routing_auth.md`

# Client-Side Routing & Route Guards

## What it is
SPA route guards (React Router, Vue Router) that hide pages based on client-side auth state.

## Why it matters
Route guards are UX only; the underlying API/data must be protected server-side too.

## Test checklist
- [ ] Directly call underlying API/data endpoints without going through the guarded route
- [ ] Confirm sensitive data isn't fetched before the auth check resolves
- [ ] Test back-button/cached-page access after logout
- [ ] Verify server-side authorization on every data-fetching call, not just route entry

## References
- OWASP Access Control Cheat Sheet

**Severity:** High
**Example test:** Call the data-fetching API endpoint behind a guarded route directly via curl/Postman without going through the SPA route guard, and confirm it's still blocked server-side.
**Last reviewed:** 2026-08-29

### `04_UI_Framework_Security/03_state_management_leaks.md`

# State Management Data Leaks

## What it is
Sensitive data stored in global client state (Redux/Vuex/Context) visible via devtools.

## Why it matters
Devtools extensions and browser inspection can expose tokens, PII, or internal data left in state.

## Test checklist
- [ ] Inspect Redux/Vuex devtools in production build for sensitive fields
- [ ] Confirm devtools are disabled/stripped in production builds
- [ ] Test that tokens/secrets are never placed in global state, only in memory scoped narrowly
- [ ] Check persisted state (redux-persist, localStorage) for sensitive data

## References
- OWASP Client-Side Storage guidance

**Severity:** Medium
**Example test:** Open Redux/Vuex devtools against the production build and search global state for tokens, secrets, or full user PII objects.
**Last reviewed:** 2026-08-29

### `04_UI_Framework_Security/04_build_config_exposure.md`

# Build Config & Source Map Exposure

## What it is
Environment variables bundled into client JS, and source maps left accessible in production.

## Why it matters
Anything bundled client-side is public; exposed source maps make reversing trivial.

## Test checklist
- [ ] Confirm only public-safe env vars are exposed to the client bundle
- [ ] Test that .map files are not accessible in production
- [ ] Search built JS bundle for accidentally-included secrets/API keys
- [ ] Confirm build pipeline separates client-safe vs server-only config

## References
- OWASP Configuration Cheat Sheet

**Severity:** Medium
**Example test:** Fetch every .map file path from the production bundle directly and confirm 404s; grep the deployed JS bundle for API key-shaped strings.
**Last reviewed:** 2026-08-29

### `04_UI_Framework_Security/05_csp_framework_compatibility.md`

# CSP Compatibility with UI Frameworks

## What it is
Configuring Content-Security-Policy so it works with a framework's inline styles/scripts without weakening it.

## Why it matters
A CSP with 'unsafe-inline' to make a framework work defeats much of its purpose.

## Test checklist
- [ ] Use nonces or hashes instead of 'unsafe-inline' where the framework requires inline scripts/styles
- [ ] Test CSP doesn't break in production build vs dev build
- [ ] Confirm CSP report-uri/report-to is monitored

## References
- OWASP Content Security Policy Cheat Sheet

**Severity:** Medium
**Example test:** Check the deployed CSP header for 'unsafe-inline'; if present, test whether nonces/hashes can replace it without breaking the framework's inline scripts.

## 05_Backend_Handling — Backend Handling

### `05_Backend_Handling/01_business_logic_validation.md`

# Business Logic Validation

## What it is
Enforcing that requests follow intended workflows/state transitions, not just syntactic validation.

## Why it matters
Technically valid requests can still violate business rules (e.g. skipping payment step).

## Test checklist
- [ ] Test skipping steps in a multi-step workflow (e.g. checkout without payment)
- [ ] Test submitting negative quantities/prices where not expected
- [ ] Test state transitions that shouldn't be reachable (e.g. cancelled -> shipped)
- [ ] Confirm server re-validates business rules, not just trusting client-submitted state

## References
- OWASP Business Logic Testing Guide

**Severity:** High
**Example test:** Attempt to call the 'ship order' step of a checkout flow while skipping the 'payment' step and confirm the server rejects the out-of-order transition.
**Last reviewed:** 2026-08-29

### `05_Backend_Handling/02_file_upload_handling.md`

# File Upload Handling

## What it is
Validating, storing, and serving user-uploaded files safely.

## Why it matters
Improper handling leads to RCE, stored XSS, or storage abuse.

## Test checklist
- [ ] Validate file type by content (magic bytes), not just extension/MIME header
- [ ] Store uploads outside the web root or in isolated object storage
- [ ] Enforce file size limits and scan for malware
- [ ] Serve uploaded files with safe Content-Disposition/Content-Type, no inline execution

## References
- OWASP File Upload Cheat Sheet

**Severity:** Critical
**Example test:** Upload a file with a .jpg extension but executable/script magic bytes inside, and confirm the server validates content type by inspecting bytes, not just the extension.
**Last reviewed:** 2026-08-29

### `05_Backend_Handling/03_orm_database_security.md`

# ORM & Database Layer Security

## What it is
Ensuring the data access layer enforces the same protections as raw SQL would need.

## Why it matters
ORMs reduce but don't eliminate injection and over-fetching risks.

## Test checklist
- [ ] Confirm raw query escape hatches in the ORM are parameterized
- [ ] Test for excessive data exposure (ORM returning full objects instead of needed fields)
- [ ] Review database user permissions (least privilege, no superuser for app connection)
- [ ] Confirm connection strings/credentials aren't hardcoded

## References
- OWASP SQL Injection Prevention Cheat Sheet

**Severity:** High
**Example test:** Search the codebase for any raw-query escape hatches in the ORM and confirm every one uses parameter binding, not string concatenation.
**Last reviewed:** 2026-08-29

### `05_Backend_Handling/04_background_job_queue_security.md`

# Background Job & Queue Security

## What it is
Securing async job processing (queues, workers, cron jobs) from injection and abuse.

## Why it matters
Queued jobs often skip the validation that sits in front of synchronous API endpoints.

## Test checklist
- [ ] Confirm queued job payloads are validated the same as API input
- [ ] Test for job payload tampering (signed/authenticated messages)
- [ ] Confirm job retries can't be abused for duplicate side effects (idempotency)
- [ ] Review access control on queue management/admin interfaces

## References
- OWASP Asynchronous Processing guidance

**Severity:** Medium
**Example test:** Submit a queued job payload with malformed/malicious data directly (bypassing the API layer) and confirm the worker validates it the same way the API would.
**Last reviewed:** 2026-08-29

### `05_Backend_Handling/05_error_handling_stack_traces.md`

# Error Handling & Stack Trace Exposure

## What it is
Ensuring errors are handled gracefully without leaking internal details.

## Why it matters
Verbose errors reveal file paths, stack traces, and internal architecture to attackers.

## Test checklist
- [ ] Confirm production mode disables detailed error pages/stack traces
- [ ] Test that generic error messages are returned to clients
- [ ] Confirm full error detail is only logged server-side, not returned in response
- [ ] Test unexpected input types (wrong content-type, malformed JSON) for graceful handling

## References
- OWASP Error Handling Cheat Sheet

**Severity:** Medium
**Example test:** Send a malformed request (bad JSON, wrong content-type) to a production endpoint and confirm the response is a generic error, not a stack trace or file path.

## 06_Data_Protection_Secrets — Data Protection & Secrets

### `06_Data_Protection_Secrets/01_encryption_at_rest.md`

# Encryption at Rest

## What it is
Encrypting stored data (databases, backups, file storage) so raw access doesn't expose plaintext.

## Why it matters
Protects data if physical storage or backups are stolen or improperly accessed.

## Test checklist
- [ ] Confirm databases/disks/object storage have encryption at rest enabled
- [ ] Confirm backups are encrypted, not just the live database
- [ ] Test that encryption keys are stored separately from the encrypted data
- [ ] Confirm sensitive fields (PII, secrets) use field-level encryption where appropriate

## References
- NIST SP 800-111 Storage Encryption

**Severity:** High
**Example test:** Confirm via cloud console/CLI that the database volume, backups, and object storage all show encryption-at-rest enabled, not just the primary disk.
**Last reviewed:** 2026-08-29

### `06_Data_Protection_Secrets/02_encryption_in_transit.md`

# Encryption in Transit

## What it is
Encrypting data as it moves between clients, services, and internal components.

## Why it matters
Prevents interception/tampering on the network, including internal service-to-service traffic.

## Test checklist
- [ ] Confirm all external traffic is HTTPS-only (no plain HTTP fallback)
- [ ] Confirm internal service-to-service traffic is also encrypted, not assumed 'trusted network'
- [ ] Test for TLS downgrade attack resistance
- [ ] Confirm database connections use TLS, not plaintext

## References
- NIST SP 800-52

**Severity:** High
**Example test:** Attempt to connect to the database and any internal service-to-service endpoint over plaintext and confirm the connection is refused, TLS-only.
**Last reviewed:** 2026-08-29

### `06_Data_Protection_Secrets/03_pii_data_classification.md`

# PII & Data Classification

## What it is
Identifying and labeling data by sensitivity so appropriate controls are applied.

## Why it matters
You can't protect what you haven't identified; misclassified data gets under-protected.

## Test checklist
- [ ] Data inventory identifies where PII/sensitive data lives
- [ ] Access controls scale with data sensitivity classification
- [ ] Confirm data retention/deletion policy matches classification requirements
- [ ] Test that exports/reports don't leak higher-sensitivity data than intended

## References
- NIST SP 800-122 PII Guide

**Severity:** Medium
**Example test:** Pull a sample data export/report and check whether it exposes any field classified as higher-sensitivity than the export's intended audience.
**Last reviewed:** 2026-08-29

### `06_Data_Protection_Secrets/04_key_management.md`

# Key Management (KMS)

## What it is
Generating, storing, rotating, and revoking cryptographic keys used across the system.

## Why it matters
Weak key management undermines every encryption control built on top of it.

## Test checklist
- [ ] Use a dedicated KMS/HSM rather than hardcoded or file-based keys
- [ ] Confirm key rotation policy is defined and automated where possible
- [ ] Confirm key access is logged and least-privilege
- [ ] Test key revocation process (e.g. after suspected compromise)

## References
- NIST SP 800-57 Key Management Guide

**Severity:** Critical
**Example test:** Confirm encryption keys live in a KMS/HSM (not a config file or env var) and walk through the documented key-revocation procedure end to end.
**Last reviewed:** 2026-08-29

### `06_Data_Protection_Secrets/05_tls_certificate_management.md`

# TLS Certificate Management

## What it is
Issuing, renewing, and monitoring TLS certificates across all deployed endpoints.

## Why it matters
Expired or misconfigured certs cause outages and downgrade attack risk.

## Test checklist
- [ ] Confirm automated certificate renewal (e.g. ACME/Let's Encrypt or managed cert service)
- [ ] Monitor certificate expiry with alerting well before expiration
- [ ] Confirm TLS 1.2+ only, weak ciphers disabled
- [ ] Test HSTS is enabled and preload-eligible if applicable

## References
- Mozilla SSL Configuration Generator

**Severity:** High
**Example test:** Run an SSL/TLS scan (e.g. against the Mozilla Observatory or testssl.sh) on each public endpoint and confirm TLS 1.2+ only, no weak ciphers, valid expiry.

### `06_Data_Protection_Secrets/06_secrets_management.md`

# Secrets Management (added)

## What it is
Secure storage, rotation, and access control for credentials, keys, and tokens.

## Why it matters
Hardcoded/leaked secrets are one of the top causes of breaches.

## Test checklist
- [ ] No secrets committed to source control
- [ ] Secrets stored in a vault (not env files in prod)
- [ ] Automatic rotation policy in place
- [ ] Access to secrets is scoped and audited

## References
- OWASP Secrets Management Cheat Sheet

**Severity:** Critical
**Example test:** Run a secret-scanning tool (e.g. gitleaks/truffleHog) across the full git history, not just HEAD, and confirm zero committed credentials.

# Blue-Green / Canary Deployment & Rollback

## What it is
Gradually shifting traffic to new versions with the ability to roll back quickly.

## Why it matters
Safe deployment strategy limits blast radius of a bad or vulnerable release.

## Test checklist
- [ ] Confirm rollback can be executed within a defined time target
- [ ] Test canary release with a small traffic percentage before full rollout
- [ ] Confirm monitoring/alerts are tied to the canary phase specifically
- [ ] Test rollback doesn't cause data corruption from schema changes

# Container Orchestration (Kubernetes) Security

## What it is
Hardening the cluster, workloads, and network policies of a container orchestration platform.

## Why it matters
A misconfigured cluster can allow lateral movement across every workload it hosts.

## Test checklist
- [ ] Confirm RBAC is enforced within the cluster, not default-permissive
- [ ] Confirm network policies restrict pod-to-pod traffic by default
- [ ] Test that secrets aren't stored as plain environment variables in manifests
- [ ] Confirm pod security standards (non-root, no privileged containers) are enforced

# Infrastructure-as-Code Scanning

## What it is
Static analysis of Terraform/CloudFormation/Pulumi configs before deployment.

## Why it matters
Misconfigured infra (open security groups, public buckets) is a top cause of breaches.

## Test checklist
- [ ] Run IaC scanning tool (e.g. tfsec/Checkov-style checks) in CI
- [ ] Confirm no security groups are open to 0.0.0.0/0 unintentionally
- [ ] Confirm storage buckets default to private
- [ ] Review IaC changes in PRs the same as application code

# Cloud Network Segmentation

## What it is
Isolating workloads into separate network segments/VPCs based on trust level.

## Why it matters
Flat cloud networks let a single compromised service reach everything else.

## Test checklist
- [ ] Confirm production workloads are segmented from lower-trust environments
- [ ] Test that a compromised low-trust service can't reach sensitive internal services directly
- [ ] Confirm security groups/firewall rules follow least-privilege, not broad internal-only allow
- [ ] Review peering/VPN connections for unintended over-broad access

## References

# Post-Deployment Monitoring

## What it is
Actively watching key metrics/logs immediately after a release goes live.

## Why it matters
Many issues (errors, latency spikes, security alerts) surface only under real production traffic.

## Test checklist
- [ ] Error rate and latency dashboards checked immediately after deploy
- [ ] Security alerting active during the post-deploy window
- [ ] Defined rollback trigger thresholds (e.g. error rate > X% triggers auto-rollback)
- [ ] On-call owner assigned for each deployment

# Feature Flags & Kill Switches

## What it is
Using feature flags to enable instant disabling of risky features without a full redeploy.

## Why it matters
Reduces time-to-mitigate when a new feature turns out to have a security or stability issue.

## Test checklist
- [ ] Confirm high-risk features are gated behind a flag with a kill switch
- [ ] Test that toggling a flag off actually disables the code path immediately
- [ ] Confirm flag management access is restricted to authorized roles
- [ ] Test flag state doesn't leak sensitive info to unauthorized users (e.g. flag payload exposed client-side)

## References

# Least-Privilege IAM for Deployment

## What it is
Scoping deployment pipeline and service credentials to the minimum permissions needed.

## Why it matters
Overprivileged deploy credentials turn a pipeline compromise into a full account compromise.

## Test checklist
- [ ] Review IAM roles used by CI/CD for least privilege
- [ ] Confirm deploy credentials are short-lived/rotated, not long-lived static keys
- [ ] Test that a compromised pipeline token can't access unrelated resources
- [ ] Separate deploy permissions per environment (staging deployer can't touch prod)

### `08_Release_Engineering_Version_Control/02_semantic_versioning.md`

# Semantic Versioning

## What it is
Using a consistent MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH scheme so version numbers communicate change impact.

## Why it matters
Inconsistent versioning makes it hard to know if an update is safe to deploy or breaks something.

## Test checklist
- [ ] Confirm a consistent versioning scheme is used across app/API
- [ ] Breaking changes always bump MAJOR version
- [ ] Version exposed in API responses/headers doesn't leak internal build details unnecessarily
- [ ] Clients can detect and handle version mismatches gracefully

## References
- Semantic Versioning 2.0.0 (semver.org)

**Severity:** Low
**Example test:** Check the last 3 releases and confirm any breaking change actually bumped the MAJOR version.

## 09_Release_Pipeline_Stages — Release Pipeline Stages

### `09_Release_Pipeline_Stages/01_local_dev_testing.md`

# Stage 1: Local / Developer Testing

## What it is
Testing on a developer's own machine or local environment before anything is shared.

## Why it matters
Cheapest place to catch bugs and obvious security issues, before they cost more downstream.

## Test checklist
- [ ] Unit and integration tests pass locally
- [ ] Security linters/SAST run locally or in pre-commit hooks
- [ ] No real production data or credentials used locally
- [ ] Local environment config clearly separated from staging/prod

## References
- OWASP SAMM - Verification practices

**Example test:** Confirm the QA environment's test data is synthetic/anonymized, not a raw copy of production customer PII.
**Last reviewed:** 2026-08-29

### `09_Release_Pipeline_Stages/03_closed_beta_group_testing.md`

# Stage 3: Closed Beta / Group Testing

## What it is
Releasing to a small, known group of external or trusted users before general availability.

## Why it matters
Validates real-world usage patterns and gathers feedback while limiting exposure if something goes wrong.

## Test checklist
- [ ] Participants are known/vetted and under appropriate agreement (NDA/terms) if needed
- [ ] Feedback and bug-report channel set up and monitored actively
- [ ] Feature flags allow disabling the beta feature instantly if issues arise
- [ ] Monitoring/alerting active specifically for the beta cohort's traffic
- [ ] Clear criteria defined for 'graduating' from beta to wider rollout

## References
- Google/Microsoft beta program practices (as reference pattern)

**Severity:** Medium
**Example test:** Confirm the beta feature flag can be disabled instantly and test that toggling it off removes it from a live beta user's session.
**Last reviewed:** 2026-08-29

### `09_Release_Pipeline_Stages/04_staged_canary_rollout.md`

# Stage 4: Staged / Canary Rollout

## What it is
Gradually increasing the percentage of real production traffic hitting the new release.

## Why it matters
Limits blast radius — a bad release only affects a small slice of users before full rollout.

## Test checklist
- [ ] Rollout percentage increased in defined steps (e.g. 1% -> 10% -> 50% -> 100%)
- [ ] Automated rollback triggers defined (error rate, latency thresholds)
- [ ] Canary cohort monitored separately from the rest of production traffic
- [ ] Sufficient bake time at each stage before proceeding to the next

## References
- Google SRE Book - Canary releases

**Severity:** High

**Last reviewed:** 2026-08-29

### `09_Release_Pipeline_Stages/05_general_availability_release.md`

# Stage 5: General Availability (GA) Release

## What it is
Making the release available to 100% of users.

## Why it matters
The point of highest exposure — everything from earlier stages should already be validated.

## Test checklist
- [ ] All earlier stage criteria met and signed off
- [ ] Release communication sent to relevant stakeholders/users
- [ ] Support/on-call team briefed and ready
- [ ] Rollback plan still available even at 100% rollout

## References
- ITIL Release Management (as reference pattern)

# Stage 8: Deprecation & End-of-Life

## What it is
Formally retiring an old version/feature once it's no longer safe or practical to support.

## Why it matters
The final stage of the lifecycle — closes the loop back to Q06 (sunset policy).

## Test checklist
- [ ] EOL date communicated well in advance
- [ ] Users migrated or forcibly upgraded before EOL date
- [ ] Deprecated infrastructure/endpoints actually decommissioned, not left dormant
- [ ] Post-mortem/retrospective captured for lessons learned across the full lifecycle

- [ ] Policy for patching critical CVEs within SLA

## References
- OWASP Dependency-Check

**Severity:** High
**Example test:** Run the SCA scanner manually against the current backend dependency tree and confirm it matches what CI reports, with no critical CVEs unpatched past SLA.
**Last reviewed:** 2026-08-29

### `10_Dependency_Supply_Chain/02_dependency_version_pinning.md`

# Dependency Version Pinning

## What it is
Locking dependencies to exact, reviewed versions instead of open ranges.

## Why it matters
Unpinned dependencies can silently pull in a compromised or breaking new version.

## Test checklist
- [ ] Lockfiles (package-lock.json, poetry.lock, etc.) committed and enforced in CI
- [ ] Dependency updates go through review, not auto-pulled at build time
- [ ] Confirm build fails if lockfile and manifest are out of sync
- [ ] Critical security patches have an expedited update path

## References
- OWASP Dependency-Check

**Severity:** Medium
**Example test:** Delete the lockfile locally and reinstall; confirm CI fails the build if the regenerated lockfile differs from the committed one.
**Last reviewed:** 2026-08-29

### `10_Dependency_Supply_Chain/03_frontend_dependency_scanning.md`

# Frontend Dependency Scanning

## What it is

## Why it matters
Frontend supply-chain attacks (malicious npm packages) are a growing attack vector.

## Test checklist
- [ ] Run npm audit / yarn audit as part of CI
- [ ] Pin dependency versions and review lockfile diffs on update
- [ ] Check for typosquatted or newly-published packages before adding
- [ ] Monitor for post-install scripts in dependencies

## References
- OWASP Dependency-Check
- npm audit docs

**Severity:** Medium
**Example test:** Run npm audit / yarn audit and manually review any newly added package for typosquatting risk or suspicious post-install scripts.

## 11_Logging_Monitoring — Logging & Monitoring

### `11_Logging_Monitoring/01_audit_logging.md`

# Audit Logging

## What it is
An immutable record of who did what, when, where, and with what result, across
both API calls and general system actions.

## Why it matters
Required for forensics, compliance, and incident response — and for APIs
specifically, it's the only reliable way to reconstruct who accessed or
changed what through a given endpoint.

## Test checklist
- [ ] Captures actor, action, timestamp, source IP, and result for every sensitive action (API and non-API)
- [ ] Logs are tamper-evident / write-once and stored separately with restricted write access
- [ ] Sensitive data (secrets, full PII) is redacted from log entries
- [ ] Retention period meets compliance requirements
- [ ] Regularly tested for completeness — can you fully reconstruct an incident from the logs alone?

## References
- OWASP Logging Cheat Sheet
- NIST SP 800-92

**Severity:** High
**Example test:** Perform a sensitive action (e.g. role change) and confirm the audit log captures actor, action, timestamp, source IP, and result — then try to alter that entry.
**Last reviewed:** 2026-08-29

### `11_Logging_Monitoring/02_log_injection.md`

# Log Injection (added)

## What it is
Untrusted input written into logs can forge entries or break parsers.

## Why it matters
Can be used to cover tracks or attack log analysis tooling.

## Test checklist
- [ ] Sanitize/encode user input before writing to logs
- [ ] Avoid free-text injection into structured log formats
- [ ] Test log viewer for stored XSS if logs are viewed in a UI

## References
- OWASP Log Injection reference

**Severity:** Medium
**Example test:** Submit a username or field containing newline characters and fake log-line content, then confirm it doesn't forge a fake log entry when written.

### `11_Logging_Monitoring/03_siem_alerting.md`

# SIEM & Alerting (added)

## What it is
Centralized log aggregation and automated alerting on suspicious patterns.

## Why it matters
Turns raw logs into actionable detection.

## Test checklist
- [ ] Critical events (auth failures, privilege changes) trigger alerts
- [ ] Alert thresholds tuned to reduce noise/fatigue
- [ ] Incident response runbook linked to each alert type

## References
- MITRE ATT&CK for detection mapping

**Severity:** Medium
**Example test:** Trigger 10 failed logins for one account in a short window and confirm a SIEM alert fires with a linked response runbook.

**Last reviewed:** 2026-08-29

### `12_Third_Party_Integration_Vendor_Risk/02_data_processing_agreements.md`

# Data Processing Agreements & Contracts

## What it is
Contractual terms governing how a vendor may use, store, and protect shared data.

## Why it matters
Without clear terms, there's no enforceable obligation on the vendor to protect your data.

## Test checklist
- [ ] DPA/contract in place before sharing personal or sensitive data with a vendor
- [ ] Contract specifies data handling, breach notification timelines, and deletion obligations
- [ ] Sub-processor use by the vendor is disclosed and approved
- [ ] This is a process checklist, not legal advice — involve legal/procurement

## References
- GDPR Article 28 (as reference pattern, not legal advice)

**Severity:** Medium
**Example test:** Confirm a signed DPA exists for every vendor receiving personal data, and that sub-processor disclosures are on file (consult legal for interpretation).

### `13_Backup_DR_Resilience/02_chaos_engineering_basics.md`

# Chaos Engineering Basics

## What it is
Deliberately injecting failures (killed instances, network latency, dependency outages) to test resilience.

## Why it matters
Confirms the system fails safely and recovers, rather than discovering this during a real outage.

## Test checklist
- [ ] Start with small-blast-radius experiments in non-prod before considering prod
- [ ] Define a hypothesis and success criteria before each experiment
- [ ] Confirm monitoring/alerting actually fires during the injected failure
- [ ] Document and fix weaknesses discovered, then re-test

## References
- Principles of Chaos Engineering (principlesofchaos.org)

### `13_Backup_DR_Resilience/04_backup_restore_testing.md`

# Backup Restore Testing

## What it is
Verifying backups can actually be restored successfully, not just that they complete.

## Why it matters
A backup that can't be restored provides false confidence and no real protection.

## Test checklist
- [ ] Full restore test performed periodically, not just backup job success checked
- [ ] Restored data verified for completeness and integrity
- [ ] Restore time measured against recovery time objectives
- [ ] Test restoring to an isolated environment, not overwriting production

## References
- NIST SP 800-34 Contingency Planning Guide

### `17_DNS_Email_Domain_Security/03_subdomain_takeover.md`

> **Authorization reminder:** Only run these checks against systems you own or have explicit written permission to test. Prefer staging/QA over production — several checks here (injection probes, IAM changes, DNS record edits) can have live side effects.


# Subdomain Takeover (added)

## What it is
A DNS record points to a third-party service (e.g. cloud storage, SaaS) that's no longer claimed, letting an attacker claim it.

## Why it matters
Allows attackers to serve content from a trusted subdomain of your own domain.

## Test checklist
- [ ] Audit all DNS CNAME/records pointing to third-party services
- [ ] Remove DNS records for decommissioned third-party services immediately
- [ ] Periodically scan for dangling DNS entries
- [ ] Test claiming decommissioned service endpoints in a controlled way before attackers do

## References
- OWASP Subdomain Takeover guidance

**Severity:** Critical
**Example test:** Audit every CNAME record pointing at a third-party service and confirm none point to a deprovisioned/unclaimed resource that could be claimed by an attacker.
**Last reviewed:** 2026-08-29

### `17_DNS_Email_Domain_Security/04_certificate_transparency_monitoring.md`

> **Authorization reminder:** Only run these checks against systems you own or have explicit written permission to test. Prefer staging/QA over production — several checks here (injection probes, IAM changes, DNS record edits) can have live side effects.


# Certificate Transparency Monitoring

## What it is
Monitoring public CT logs for TLS certificates issued for your domains.

## Why it matters
Detects unauthorized or unexpected certificate issuance (potential impersonation) early.

## Test checklist
